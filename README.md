# Cipher
A very simple substitution cipher implementation in C.

Both **generate.c** and **encode.c** compile into executables.

- **generate.exe** outputs cipher key which is a permutation of A to Z character set.
- **encode.c** encodes text from standard input using the cipher key loaded from a file.
